- |MajorFeature| `melt` now supports complex `pandas.melt` operations, including
regex (flex) support and more. Includes an example.
- |Enhancement| `vectorize` now supports caching for each step
- |Fix| keyword argument `cache`, default set to False
- Removed a number of redundant code, such as checksums for MetaPanda
- |API| `turb.Pipe` and `compute` as a part of MetaPanda are now deprecated to be removed in v0.3.0

`turbopanda.dev`
................
- |Efficiency| `cache` for non-pandas objects uses `joblib` to serialize/pickle the object

`turbopanda.plot`
.................
- |Feature| Added `errorbar1d` function to draw barplots with errorbars.
- |Feature| Added `bar1d` function to efficiently draw barplots, with automatic sorting and colouring
- |Feature| Added `widebar` to provide a hued barplot functionality instinctively to pandas.DataFrames.
- |Enhancement| `widebox` function now has a `sort` parameter which sorts variables by the mean.
- |Enhancement| `gridplot` function parameter `ax_size` now accepts tuples as well as an integer for non-square shapes
- |Fix| An issue in `scatter` where colors were not corresponding to legend

`turbopanda.pipe`
.................
- |Feature| Added `rename_index`, `rename_columns` and `replace` pipeable functions

`turbopanda.str`
................
- |Enhancement| Added `pattern`, collapsing down `strpattern` and `patcolumnmatch` functions
into a catch-all operation
- |Enhancement| `string_replace` function now accepts lists/tuples as inputs
as well as just pandas.Series and Index.
- |Fix| `common_substrings` now properly handles cases where list a only has one element, with no b. This simply
returns the string in question

`turbopanda.merge`
..................
- |Enhancement| Includes proper verbose outputs to see which columns are merging together

`turbopanda.utils`
..................
- |Feature| Added `umap` and variants to add with maps, caching and parallelism in loops
- |Feature| Added `absdifference` to the .sets methods, to handle absolute set difference (we had
issues with symmetric difference only in the past)
- |Enhancement| Added `retuple` function to reshape lists of tuples automatically and with ease.
