Changelog
---------
We are now public on PyPI.

- |MajorFeature| New sampling folder with `multivariate_gaussians` method to get correlated synthetic data.
- |Feature| High-density scatterplots can be fine-tuned using `scatter_slim`, a new plotting function to reduce subsequent file image size
- |Enhancement| `turb.read` now accepts `.pkl` files using joblib
- |API| Added `tqdm` library as requirement
- |API| Removed `statsmodels` requirement
- |API| Removed `remove_dup_cols` function from utils removing `toolz` requirement

`turbopanda.MetaPanda`
......................
- |Feature| Added `shape` property to access df shape under the hood
- |Enhancement| `source_` setter property now writes a file if not present
- |Enhancement| `MetaPanda.write` now accepts `.pkl` files, and dumps using joblib
- |Fix| using the `__setitem__` property now works, so column assignment is functional
- |API| `add_prefix` and `add_suffix` to be removed next version

`turbopanda.corr`
.................
- |Enhancement| `correlate` now uses `tqdm` progressbar library
- |Fix| `bicorr` now uses Spearman-rank correlation between two integer-based columns x and y.
- |API| `bicorr` and `partial_bicorr` now return float or dict rather than 1-line pandas.DataFrame object

`turbopanda.dev`
................
- |API| `cached` and `cached_chunk` are now deprecated, to be removed in 0.3

`turbopanda.ml`
...............
- |API| `ml_ready` and `get_best_model` is now deprecated, to be removed in 0.3

`turbopanda.pipe`
.................
- |Feature| Added `impute_missing` to impute missing values to continous, integer columns.
- |Feature| Added `add_prefix`, `add_suffix` to pipeable methods
- Added `index_name` and `krange` functions

`turbopanda.plot`
.................
- |Feature| Added `hinton` method to plot correlation matrices using Hinton's technique
- |Feature| Added `scatter_slim` function which is the same as `scatter` but plots less points for high-density scatters.
- |Enhancement| `widebar` now has keyword argument allowance.
- |Enhancement| `bar1d` has a scale parameter to do log transform plots
- |Enhancement| `legend` now allows for ncol and title selection
- |Fix| `cat_array_to_color` now handles numpy 'O' type object inputs correctly.

`turbopanda.str`
................
- |Efficiency| `levenshtein` now supports a parameter for parallelization with `joblib`
- |Fix| `pattern` now drops NA values when receives a pandas.Series object before regex search

`turbopanda.utils`
..................
- |Feature| Added `zipe` function, with extended zip functionality. Comes with examples
- |Enhancement| `cache` now exists as a util option, gradually making `dev.cache` redundant
- |Enhancement| `umap` and `umapc` now have in-built progress bar using tqdm library
- |Efficiency| `intersect` and `union` now use `reduce` instead of for loops
- |Fix| `arrays_dimension` now properly handles DataFrames
- |Fix| `intersect` and `union` now use `pd.Index.intersection` and union respectively instead of `operator.and` etc.
- |API| `lparallel` is now deprecated, to be removed in 0.3

`turbopanda.sample`
...................
- |MajorFeature| Added `covariance_matrix` and `multivariate_gaussians` to generate synthetic datasets.
- |Fix| Bounded `corr_ratio` parameter to ensure semipositive-definite matrix property
